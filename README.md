# ATM Simulator

ATM Simulator is a GUI application that mimics the look and functionality of a real ATM. The purpose of this project is to showcase some of my Java knowledge and to serve as a learning tool for those who are unfamiliar with how an ATM works.

While I'm still in the process implementing and perfecting some of the project's basic functionality, I already have plans for what's to come next, namely using an embedded Derby to store account information, trasnaction logs, etc.
